Cost-Sensitive Deep Learning in Keras_
/ Deep learning neural networks are a flexible class of machine learning algorithms that perform
/ well on a wide range of problems. Neural networks are trained using the backpropagation of
| error algorithm that involves calculating errors made by the model on the training dataset and

| | updating the model weights in proportion to those errors. The limitation of this method of
' training is that examples from each class are treated the same, which for imbalanced datasets
_ means that the model is adapted a lot more for one class than another.
| | | | The backpropagation algorithm can be updated to weigh misclassification errors in proportion
to the importance of the class, referred to as weighted neural networks or cost-sensitive neural
j networks. This has the effect of allowing the model to pay more attention to examples from the
| | minority class than the majority class in datasets with a severely skewed class distribution. In
| this tutorial, you will discover weighted neural networks for imbalanced classification. After —
| completing this tutorial, you will know: |
/ _ @ How the standard neural network algorithm does not support imbalanced classification.
| | e How the neural network training algorithm can be modified to weight misclassification
| Oo errors in proportion to class importance.

| | e How to configure class weight for neural networks and evaluate the effect on model

| performance.
| . _ Let’s get started.
