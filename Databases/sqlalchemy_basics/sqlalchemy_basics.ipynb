    "1. Connecting to your database\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Python world, there are several great tools that we can use when working with databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Meet SQLAlchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "One of those is SQLAlchemy that we will be using throughout this course. SQLAlchemy will allow us to generate SQL queries by writing Python code. You should still consider learning how to write queries in SQL as well. SQLAlchemy has two main components. The part we will be focusing on is often referred to as \"core\" part of SQLAlchemy. It's really focused around the relational model of the database. Additionally, there is the Object Relational Model or ORM part of SQLAlchemy that is really focused around data models and classes that you as a programmer create.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There are many types of databases\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of databases, and each database type has its own quirks and unique capabilities. You'll commonly find SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle when working with data. SQLAlchemy provides a way to operate across all of these database types in a consistent manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Connecting to a database\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect to a database, we need a way to talk to it, and an engine provides that common interface. To create an engine, we import the create_engine function from sqlalchemy; we then use the create_engine function and supply it a connection string that provides the details needed to connect to a database. Finally once we have an engine, we are ready to make a connection using the connect method on the engine. It's worth noting that SQLAlchemy won't actually make the connection until we give it some work to execute. So to review, an engine is the common interface to the database, which requires a connection string to provide the details used to find and connect to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. A word on connection strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go any further, let's talk a bit more about connection strings. In their simplest form, they tell us what kind of database we are talking to and how we should access it. In this example, you can see that we are using the sqlite database driver\n",
    "\n",
    "6. A word on connection strings\n",
    "\n",
    "and the database file named census_nyc-dot-sqlite which is in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What's in your database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have an engine and a connection, we need to know what tables are in the database. We'll start again by importing the create_engine function and creating an engine to our database. Finally, we can use the table_names method of the engine which returns a list of tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know what table we want to work on, we need a way to access that table with python. To do that we are going to use a handy process called reflection, which reads the database and builds a Table object that we can use in our code. We already have created our engine, so we begin by importing the MetaData and Table objects needed for reflection. The MetaData object is a catalog that stores database information such as tables so we don't have to keep looking them up. To reflect the table, we initialize a MetaData object. Next, we use the SQLAlchemy Table object and provide the table name we got earlier from the table_names method. We also supply our metadata instance, and then instruct it to autoload the table using the engine. Finally, we can use the function repr to view the details of our table that we stored as census. This allows us to see the names of the columns, such as the 'state' and 'sex' columns, along with their types, such as VARCHAR and INTEGER. This process of reflection may seem a bit of an overhead, but it will make understanding your databases and extracting information from them far easier downstream."

    "Autoloading Tables from a database\n",
    "SQLAlchemy can be used to automatically load tables from a database using something called reflection. **Reflection is the process of reading the database and building the metadata based on that information**. It's the **opposite of creating a Table by hand** and is very useful **for working with existing databases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform reflection, you will first need to import and initialize a MetaData object. MetaData objects contain information about tables stored in a database. During reflection, the MetaData object will be populated with information about the reflected table automatically, so we only need to initialize it before reflecting by calling MetaData().\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need to import the Table object from the SQLAlchemy package. Then, you use this Table object to read your table from the engine, autoload the columns, and populate the metadata. This can be done with a single call to Table(): using the Table object in this manner is a lot like passing arguments to a function. For example, to autoload the columns with the engine, you have to specify the keyword arguments autoload=True and autoload_with=engine to Table().\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to view information about the object you just created, you will use the repr() function. For any Python object, repr() returns a text representation of that object. For SQLAlchemy Table objects, it will return the information about that table contained in the metadata."

    "1. Introduction to SQL queries\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL query language can be used to do anything within the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SQL Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "It can select data, insert new data, update existing data, and delete it. It can also be used to create, alter and delete tables and columns. The first SQL statement we'll learn is the select statement, which provides the basic method of extracting information from your database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Basic SQL querying\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of a select statement is select COLUMNS from TABLE CONDITIONS. For example, we can select the pop2008 column from the people table. We can also select all the columns from the people table with an asterisk. Let's execute this last query.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Basic SQL querying\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by importing create_engine and creating an engine. Next, we will establish a connection by using the connect method on the engine. Then we can define our select statement and pass it to the execute method on the connection. This gives us an object we can use to fetch the results, which we assign to the variable results_proxy. Then we tell results_proxy to fetch all the results via the fetchall method. Now results will contain all of the data from our people table. Let's pause for just a moment and look at that object that the execute method gave us.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ResultProxy vs ResultSet\n",
    "\n",
    "That object is called a ResultProxy and it can be used in a variety of different ways to get the data returned by our query. When we use a fetch method, such as fetchall, on the ResultProxy, we get a ResultSet that contains the actual data we asked for in the query. This separation between the ResultProxy and the ResultSet allows us to fetch as much or as little data as we desire. We'll explore this more in a later section. Let's learn how to work with a ResultSet.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Handling ResultSets\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we are using the results from the prior query. We'll start by getting the first_row of the results using an index of 0. By printing the first row, we can see the data it contains. If we want to know what columns are in the row, we can find out by using the keys method. Finally, we print the value of the state column from the first row, by using the column name as an attribute on the row object.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. SQLAlchemy to build queries\n",
    "\n",
    "In the prior query example, we wrote a normal SQL statement as a string; however, manipulating a string to build more complex statements can be very overwhelming. The beauty of SQLAlchemy is that it allows us to assemble these complex statements in a Pythonic way. Pythonic refers to code that adheres to the idioms of Python's common guidelines and expresses its intent in a highly readable way. SQLAlchemy also hides the difference between database types so we can focus on the data we want to work with instead of the differences we might encounter in each database type. Let's rebuild the same query using SQLAlchemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. SQLAlchemy querying\n",
    "\n",
    "The first three steps of creating an engine and establishing a connection will be the same. After that, we will need to initialize our metadata and reflect the table as we did previously. Then in line 7, we build our select statement. Hang tight we'll talk more about this in a second. Finally, we execute the statement and fetch all the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. SQLAlchemy select statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQLAlchemy select statement works the same as a SQL select statement, and in its most basic form takes a list of Column or Table objects. For example, stmt equals select census will select all the columns of all the rows in the census table. SQLAlchemy generates the same SQL statement we wrote by hand. We can see that by using the print function on the statement which outputs SELECT * FROM census."

    "1. Filtering and targeting data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the basics of connecting to the database and making a query down, it's time to dig deeper into select queries. So far, we've selected all the rows from a table. However, there is a way to filter rows by their values in particular columns using a where() clause on our select statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Where clauses\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say that we want to select all the records for the state of California. We start with the same select statement and add a where clause onto it that specifies that the value in the 'State' column must be equal to California. We then execute the statement and fetch all the results, as we have done before. We wrap up by looping over the results and print the state and age column from each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Where clauses\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, where clauses restrict data by performing an evaluation of a condition. Often this is a column that we want to compare with a value or another column. In the prior example, we tested equality of column values with 'California'. In addition to equality, with numerical values, there are also operators for greater than, less than and the other standard math comparison operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to such comparisons, there are also SQL expressions that provide more complex conditions than simple operators. A few common expression are in_() which match the column's value against a list, like() which matches the column's value against a partial value with wild cards, and between() which checks to see if the column's value is between two supplied values. There are many others as well. These expressions are available as methods on our Column objects. We can use such expressions to do things such as find all the state names that start with 'New'. In fact, Let's do just that.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the same basic select statement and add a where clause with the state column and use the startswith method on that column. We then loop over the ResultProxy and print the state and population in the year 2000. Note that we didn't call a fetch method in this example. This is a feature of SQLAlchemy to allow the ResultProxy to be used as the target of a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Conjunctions\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use conjunctions which allow us to have multiple criteria in a where clause. The conjunctions are and_(), not_(), and or_() and they work just like they would in a sentence. Conjunctions can be useful for getting exactly the data we want. You might notice that these methods have an _ in their names. This is to avoid conflicting with the Python methods of the same name. It's also possible to nest multiple conjunctions to get extremely specific about the data we select, but that's not covered in this class. Let's see an example usage of conjunctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Conjunctions\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Ordering query results\n",
    "\n",
    "Often when we are building queries,\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Order by clauses\n",
    "\n",
    "we will want to order the return data alphabetically, numerically, or by dates. It is easy to do so in SQLAlchemy by using the order_by() method on any statement, which by default orders from lowest to highest. In the case of strings, this means in alphabetical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Order by ascending\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially when I selected the state field from all the records in a prior query, I got Illinois back as the first result. I really want the states in alphabetical order. To do that built a select statement for the state column of the census table. Then I append an order_by clause on my select statement that targets the state column. After executing that statement, I can see that the results now start with Alabama.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Order by descending\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to sort from highest to lowest, we can do so by wrapping a column in the order_by() clause with the desc() function, which is short for 'descending' and will reverse the natural sort order and make it highest to lowest. You'll get to practice using the desc() function in the interactive exercises that follow this video.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Order by multiple\n",
    "\n",
    "Often we might want to order by one column such as district and then within each district order by age. We can accomplish this by passing multiple columns to the order_by() method and it will fully sort the first column, then within the rows that have matching values for the first column it sorts by the second column and so on until all sort columns are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Order by multiple\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, I want to get all the states in alphabetical order. Then within each state, I want to get the genders in alphabetical order as well. To demonstrate this, I've already performed a select statement to get the state and sex from the census table where it's in the wrong order. Next, we build a select statement for the state and sex columns. Then, we append an order by clause that targets the state and sex columns. Now I can see that after executing the query, we get Alabama and Female as the first state and sex combo in our result set."

    "### Aggregate Transcripts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Counting, summing, and grouping data\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, we want to be able to count the data we are working with or calculate the sum of a column in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SQL functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Things like count and sum are SQL aggregation functions, and they can be found in the func sqlalchemy module. It's far more efficient to let SQL perform these functions than to get all the results and loop over them in Python. We call them aggregation functions because they collapse multiple records into one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sum example\n",
    "\n",
    "For example what if I wanted to get a sum of the census pop2008 column for all the records? After I had created an engine, metadata, and reflected the table, I would import the func module. Then in my select statement where I would normally just put the column, I put the column wrapped by func-dot-sum. Then I use the scalar fetch method to get back just a value and print it. It's important not to import the sum function directly, because it will conflict with Python's built-in sum function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Group by\n",
    "\n",
    "Often when using a function, we want to do so by some grouping of another column. For example, we may want to get a sum of the population aggregated by sex in the census database. To do so, we can use a group_by() clause to specify the data we want to aggregate by.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Group by\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a sum of the population by gender in the census database, we would select the sex column and the func.sum of the pop2008 column. Then we would append a group by clause that targets the sex column. Then when we execute the query and get the results, we will have the data summed by the sex value of each record.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Group by\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like order_by, the group_by clause can accept multiple columns and will group with in the groups from left to right. Every column in the select statement must in the group_by clause or wrapped in a function such as sum or count.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Group by multiple\n",
    "\n",
    "We could go a step further and group by both sex and age to get the number of people for each sex by age in the 2008 population. We'd just add the age column to both the select statement and the group_by clause as shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Handling ResultSets from functions\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use a function such as sum or count, the column name that represents the function in our results is set to a placeholder. For example, if we had a count function in our select statement it would appear as the count_1 column in the result set. This can make it difficult to handle the result set; however, we can use the label() method on a function to give the output column a specific name.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Using label()\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we wanted to calculate the population by sex, you can see that it returns a sum_1 column in the result set. if we wanted to call that pop2008sum in the result set, we would use the label method on our func-dot-sum clause. Then append the usual group by clause onto the statement, and after executing the query, I would be able to use that name when accessing the components of each result in the result set."

    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLAlchemy's `func` module provides access to built-in SQL functions that can make operations like counting and summing faster and more efficient.\n",

    "Jason used `func.sum()` to get a sum of the pop2008 column of census as shown below:\n",

    "`select([func.sum(census.columns.pop2008)])`\n",

    "`select([func.count(census.columns.pop2008)])`\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, if you only want to count the distinct values of pop2008, you can use the .distinct() method:\n",

    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will practice using func.count() and .distinct() to get a count of the distinct number of states in census.\n",
