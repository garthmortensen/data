i think with the excel mapping, we were doing

**Definitive Source Mapping** - Determine the source and destination for each DATT and FACT. e.g. product or customer is in this data model and that data model. What about customer state? Customer city? 

Identify data mappings from 1+ sources into the integrated model

- which Data Model(s) should we extract information from? So take it from Sales OLTP, or Shipping OLTP...
- which Data Server(s) should be used? The same data model can appear on multiple dbs. You specificy the db on a specific server
- what information should be extracted? which columns, which rows?
- how do we filter? customers from 2018, or from midwest
- what if there are conflicts? Alice lives in MN, but other source says WI
- what if there are system failures? what if there's a timeout on the server?
- frequency and duration concerns? when was it last updated? How long will it run for? It might determine which source to use/
- system load considerations? How busy is the system? 

For each DATT and FACT, we identify a specific source for the content. This source is typically a single column, from a single table, in a single data model deployed on a single database instance. 

**Easiest scenario: If there is 1 db, 1 data model, single table, single column, that has all info you need, Done!**
